Step 1: Check If Node.js Is Installed

   1. Open VS Code.

   2. Open the Terminal in VS Code (Ctrl + ` or View > Terminal).

   3. Type the following command and press Enter:

         node -v

      If Node.js is installed, it will return a version like:

         v18.16.0

      If not, proceed to Step 2.

   4. Check if npm is installed:

         npm -v

      It should return a version like:

         9.5.1



Step 2: Install Node.js (If Not Installed)

  If Node.js is missing, install it:


   1. Download Node.js from the official website ( https://nodejs.org/en ).
     Choose the LTS (Long-Term Support) version for stability.

   2. Run the installer and make sure to check "Add to PATH" during installation.

   3. Restart VS Code after installation.


Step 3: Restart VS Code & Verify npm
 
  After restarting, open VS Code Terminal and run:

         npm -v

  If npm works, go to your project folder and run:

         npm run start
